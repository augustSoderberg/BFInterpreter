Long story short this is an interpreter, written in Java, for the esoteric programming language "Brainfuck".

I wrote this after taking my first every computer science course (hence the inefficiencies, strange logic, and poor variable names)
and decided not to edit any of it as a reminder of my then newly-discovered love for compuer science.
